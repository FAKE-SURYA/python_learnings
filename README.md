## 📚 Learning Sources

I'm currently learning Python from two highly valuable resources:

- [🎥 Bro Code's 12-Hour Python Full Course](https://youtu.be/ix9cRaBkVe0?si=srjSdJ9v55GMXjAU)  
  A fast-paced, hands-on crash course that covers everything from basics to OOP, file handling, and more.
  The best thing with Bro code's pyhton course is that he builds a small project along side as we move forward clearing the concepts
  I use it to build mini-projects quickly and reinforce concepts in real time.

- [📘 GeeksforGeeks: Python-foundation-2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/python-foundation-2?tab=Chapters)
- Got this course free of cost thanks to GfG, good thing about this course is that it is very structured and have articles which will help you understanding the concepts and problems section to make sure you implement what have you learned and quizzes for quick recap of the    learnings
> **Learning and building one project at a time**
> **Main focus is to build a small project as I learn even if it is a command line calculator  &  Build a real world project and               deploy it in a month or two that is my small goal for now**
